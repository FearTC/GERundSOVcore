GER_speeches_category_desc:0 "The object of rhetoric is not truth, but persuasion. A man has made at least a start on discovering the meaning of human life when he plants shade trees under which he knows full well he will never sit. Therefore when at least one of the parties to a conflict wants something more than it wants peace, war is inevitable."

sp_falloffrance:0 "Address the Reichstag on the Fall of France"
sp_falloffrance_desc:0 ""Mr. Churchill should make an exception and place trust in me when as a prophet I now proclaim: a great empire will be destroyed! I am fully aware that the continuation of this war will end only in the complete shattering of one of the two warring parties. Mr. Churchill may believe this to be Germany. I know it to be England!""

declare_war_SOV_desc:0 ""German people! At this moment a deployment of forces is taking place that, in its extent and scope, is the greatest the world hitherto has seen. I decided today to once again lay the fate and future of the German Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers. May the Lord God help us especially in this fight!""
declare_war_USA:0 "Declare war on the United States"
declare_war_USA_desc:0 ""Our opponents should not deceive themselves. In the two thousand years of recorded German history, our people have never been more determined and united than today. The Lord of the universe has been so generous to us in recent years that we bow in gratitude before a Providence that has permitted us to be members of such a great nation. We thank Him, that along with those in earlier and coming generations of the German nation, our deeds of honor may also be recorded in the eternal book of German history!""
sp_ger_totalwar:0 "Make a call for Total War"
sp_ger_totalwar_desc:0 ""The English say that Germans want capitulation, not Total War! Do you want Total War? Do you want it - if need be - more total and radical than anything we could even imagine today? I ask you: Are you determined to follow the Führer, to bring the war to a victorious conclusion, even if this means bearing the heaviest of personal burdens?! And so, from now on let our slogan be: Rise up people, and unleash the storm!""

GEN_speeches_category_desc:0 "Of all the talents bestowed upon men, none is so precious as the gift of oratory. He who enjoys it wields a power more durable than that of a great king. He is an independent force in the world. Abandoned by his party, betrayed by his friends, stripped of his offices, whoever can command his power is still formidable."
sp_POL:0 "Reject German claims on Danzig & Poznan"
sp_POL_desc:0 ""Peace is a precious and a desirable thing. Our generation, bloodied in wars, certainly deserves peace. But peace, like almost all things of this world, has its price, a high but a measurable one. We in Poland do not know the concept of peace at any price. There is only one thing in the lives of men, nations and countries that is without price. That thing is honor!""

This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine. Some of you, perhaps, have already heard what it contains but I would just like to read it to you: ... We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again!""
sp_ENG_warwithGER:0 "Declare war on Germany"
sp_ENG_warwithGER_desc:0 ""This morning the British Ambassador in Berlin handed the German Government a final note stating that, unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.""
sp_ENG_bloodtoiltearssweat:0 "Hold 'Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat' Speech"
sp_ENG_bloodtoiltearssweat_desc:0 ""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat. You ask, what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: Victory. Victory at all costs! Victory in spite of all terror! Victory, however long an hard the road may be, for without victory there is no survival.""
sp_ENG_fightonthebeaches:0 "Hold 'We Shall Fight on the Beaches' Speech"
sp_ENG_fightonthebeaches_desc:0 ""We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.

sp_SOV_patrioticwar_desc:0 ""Comrades! Citizens! Brothers and sisters! Fighters of our Army and Navy! I am addressing you, my friends! Side by side with the Red Army, the entire soviet people are rising in defense of our native land. Above all, it is essential that our people, the Soviet people, understand the full immensity of the danger that threatens our country and abandon all complacency, all heedlessness, all those moods of peaceful constructive work. The enemy is cruel and implacable. He is out to seize our lands, watered with our sweat, to seize our grain and oil secured by our labour. All our work must be immediately reconstructed on a war footing, everything must be subordinated to the interests of the front and the task of organizing the demolition of the enemy. Our forces are numberless. The overweening enemy will soon learn this to his cost. All our forces for support of our heroic Red Army and our glorious Red navy! All forces of the people - for the demolition of the enemy! Forward, to our victory!""

sp_USA_warwithJAP_desc:0 ""Yesterday, December 7th, 1941 - a date which will live in infamy - the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. The United States was at peace with that nation. And, at the solicitation of Japan, was still in conservation with it's government and it's emperor, looking towards the maintenance of peace in the Pacific. I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, 7 December 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese Empire.""
